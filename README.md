# Your Application Name Setup

Install and update Your Application Name automatically via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). Integrate it into your CI/CD process or test it locally with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).

## Local installation with Vagrant for testing

Scenario: To test Your Application Name a little bit with minimal effort, you can use a local installation in the local VirtualBox VM via Vargant. This is also suitable for developers to perform "system tests" for their changes.

Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Perform the following steps in the terminal (Linux / macOS) or in the GitBash (Windows):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aamir9138/TIB-Terminology-Service-Statistics-box.git
cd TIB-Terminology-Service-Statistics-box
vagrant up
```

When the installation is complete, Your Application Name will be running on
* 192.168.98.141

### Helpful Vagrant commands

* `vagrant up` - Creates a new VM and runs the Ansible playbook, if no VM exists. Turn on a shut down VM, if the VM was created before
* `vagrant halt` - Shuts down the VM
* `vagrant destroy` - Removes the VM
* `vagrant reload --provision` - Restarts the VM and re-runs the Ansible playbook 
* `vagrant provision` - Re-runs the Ansible playbook without updating the ansible-scripts and without restarting the VM
* `vagrant ssh` - SSH into the running VM

## Integration into a CI/CD process

Scenario: Install Your Application Name automatically on an existing system like your Test/Prod system. Since this is done via Docker containers here, the environment from which the installation is performed is always the same and there are no conflicts due to different Ansible versions on the installation host. This makes the installation more stable. You will be able to start the installation fully automatically with a simple click in the browser or even use a scheduled or triggered installation.

### GitLab CI/CD
